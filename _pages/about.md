I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My research fields include urban economics, development economics, and economic history. My research considers two general themes: the importance of transportation networks for location choices of individuals and firms, and the role of institutions on economic development across Native American reservations. My recent work focuses on the historic and contemporary consequences of Federal Indian Policy with an emphasis on property rights and governance.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Colorado, Boulder and my B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Montana. I was previously an Assistant Professor at Vassar College.
