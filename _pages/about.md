I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Vassar College. My research fields include urban economics, development economics, and economic history. My research considers two general themes: the importance of transportation networks for location choices of individuals and firms, and the role of institutions on economic development across Native American reservations. My recent work focuses on the historic and contemporary consequences of Federal Indian Policy with an emphasis on property rights and governance.

I teach Urban and Regional Economics and Economic History of the Americas. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Colorado, Boulder and my B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Montana.
